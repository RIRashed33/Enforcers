                                    <p class="large">The San Diego Enforcers began in 1999 as an offshoot from the now defunct San Diego Posse. During their first season, the Enforcers went 5-0 in league play and secured their first NPSFL Western Division Championship. Due to financial difficulties, the Enforcers did not compete from 2001 -2006.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <span>2006</span>
                                    <p class="large">In 2006, the team was resurrected by Enforcers Ring of Honor members Jason Sullivan and Greg Ellis. The team returned with a new red and black theme and was built into one of the most respected organizations in the NPSFL. Between 2006 and 2010, the San Diego Enforcers raised over $50,000 for various charities including: Susan G Komen for the Cure and the Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund. The Enforcers also won their second Western Division Championship in 2009.</p>

                                    <span>2010</span>
                                    <p class="large">In 2010, the Enforcers’ front office leadership was turned over to President Dave King and Vice President Jordan Mirakian. During their tenure from 2010 to 2014, the Enforcers raised nearly $70,000 for charities such as United Cerebral Palsy of San Diego, Travis Manion Foundation, Wounded Warrior and the San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation. On June 23, 2012, the San Diego Enforcers defeated the FDNY Bravest 16-15 in historic Balboa Stadium in front of over 4,500 fans to secure their first NPSFL National Championship. The win marked the first football National Championship in San Diego in 50 years. The Enforcers were inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions and honored by the San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. The Mayor of San Diego declared June 23, 2012, San Diego Enforcers day throughout San Diego County. After finishing 4-1 in league play in 2013, the Enforcers secured their 4th Western Division title in 2014 and returned to the National Championship game. The Enforcers fell short that day to the NYPD Finest at Cathedral Catholic High School.</p>

                                    <span>2015</span>
                                    <p class="large">The 2015 season marked another change in Enforcers history. With a new front office and a renewed focus, the Enforcers took the organization to new heights both on and off the field. With another undefeated regular season and a 5th Western Division Championship , San Diego traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina to take on the Charlotte Cobras in their 3rd National Championship game in 4 years. Prior to the Championship, Charlotte had not surrendered a single point to their opponents. San Diego fought valiantly and held an early lead over Charlotte. They would ultimately fall to the Cobras, 35-20 on a warm rainy night. Off the field, the Enforcers made more than $26,000 in charitable contributions in 2015. This marked the highest amount ever given in a single season for this illustrious franchise.</p>

                                    <span>2016</span>
                                    <p class="large">Entering the 2016 season, the Enforcers faced a grueling schedule; taking on the defending National Champions, the Charlotte Cobras, as well as, the titans of the NYPD Finest and rivals, the LA Centurions. The Enforcers battled through every game and came away with yet another undefeated regular season. Entering their 4th National Championship game in 5 years and their 3rd in a row, the Enforcers were not to be denied this time. An amazing 42-0 championship win was had in front of the home San Diego crowd at Cathedral Catholic HS. The nation watched as the Enforcers hosted the first NPSFL national pay per view TV event when they defeated the LA Centurions for the second time that season.</p>

                                    <span>2020</span>
                                    <p class="large">In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world of sports to an unprecedented halt. The pandemic disrupted not only professional sports but also amateur and youth competitions, the NPSFL was not exempt from these disruptions as the entire league was shut down for the season. As the 2021 season was about to get underway, California was still is a state of partial shutdown, this caused the league to continue with only around half of the teams competing. While the recovery process was challenging, the resilience of sports teams and their ability to adapt to these unprecedented circumstances allowed them to gradually return to competition and rebuild connections with their fans and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the importance of sports in bringing people together and providing a sense of normalcy during challenging times.</p>

                                    <span>2022</span>
                                    <p class="large">In 2022, the Enforcers faced the challenge of finding players, causing the team to move to division II. At the start of the 2023 season, when faced with a shortage of players, the team embraced a “quality over quantity” mentality. Each member committed themselves fully, taking on multiple roles and responsibilities. They focused on intensive training and conditioning to maximize their skills and endurance. The team’s coaches and leaders played a pivotal role, devising innovative strategies that capitalized on their unique strengths. They fostered a culture of unity and unwavering belief in their collective abilities. As they progressed through the season, their underdog status fueled their motivation, and they used it as a driving force. The Enforcers’s were able to beat all the odds against them and made it to and won the 2023 Division II Championship as they hosted the Dallas Defenders.</p>
