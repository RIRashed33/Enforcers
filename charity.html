Moms with children with special needs often cannot get direct aid or support. Many outlets for support are targeted towards the needs of the child, which does not address housing, therapy, and support for moms. A single mom faces many uphill battles, juggling time and scarce resources while trying to provide love and support for their child. Mix in the overwhelming specter of a child with long term special needs, and you have a population in dire need of our community’s support.</p>

                                <p class="large">In 2010, the Enforcers’ front office leadership was turned over to President Dave King and Vice President Jordan Mirakian. During their tenure from 2010 to 2014, the Enforcers raised nearly $70,000 for charities such as United Cerebral Palsy of San Diego, Travis Manion Foundation, Wounded Warrior and the San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation. On June 23, 2012, the San Diego Enforcers defeated the FDNY Bravest 16-15 in historic Balboa Stadium in front of over 4,500 fans to secure their first NPSFL National Championship. <br><br>The win marked the first football National Championship in San Diego in 50 years. The Enforcers were inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions and honored by the San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium. </p>
